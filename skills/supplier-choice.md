# Supplier Choice
## for Tempelhof projects


### for hardware: 
* local supplier (small and local enough to care about us as a customer)
* we make a diffence for them so they make sure it will work

### for software
* preferably open source, all from upstream
    * (paid) custom dev into upstream
    * to gain independence, for future changes
