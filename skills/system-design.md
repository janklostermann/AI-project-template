# System Design

This contains fundamental design principles that should be applied

## System characteristics
* modular, 
* extensible, 
* with open standard interfaces
* well-documented:
  * what it is about, 
  * what shall be achieved, 
  * only in special cases explaining the implementation approach, where it cannot be derived from the implementation itself
